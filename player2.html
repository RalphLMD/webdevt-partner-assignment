			<h2>1. When my dad came back here in the Philippines for a month of vacation</h2>
			<p>My dad came back on the first of week of July and stayed in the Philippines until the last week of August. During these past 2 months we`ve been able to bond and go out together as a family. We went to different malls, eat at different kinds of restaurants (Japanese, Italian and mostly Korean), We also watched a lot of movies in the cinemas like Spider-man: Homecoming, Hello Love Goodbye and more. Even at home we were able to spend time together in the simplest things like watching T.V. (PBA, HBO films and more), general cleaning and doing chores in the house, washing the car and walking the dog together. I can say that our bond as a family has increased and that the moments spent together was very much worth it. </p>

			<h2>2. Hackathon</h2>
			<p> - During the past month of June this year we were able to join a competition on programming called Hackathon in which we were tasked to solve a problem and create a solution depending on the theme. This year the theme was on the Agricultural field, unfortunately we didn`t able to finish our program and product during the 2 days’ time limit though joining the competition has given us many insights on what to come also the experiences we gathered are new and it was very much worth it. We learned how the flow of the competition worked so the next time we join another hackathon competition we will know what we are going to do and how to adjust and adapt to it. Also, there are a lot of people in which we can learn from due to them studying in different schools and fields. Not only that we were able to bond together as friends and competitors/rivals.</p>

			<h2>3. Tagaytay Trip</h2>
			<p>On the 22th day of August due to its being our long-term break, me and my block mates were able to spend a day together in a trip to Tagaytay. We planned this for a very long time for as long I can remember during the early days of our 1st term. At first, we weren`t sure about whether the trip would continue and be cancelled in the end because a lot of them were not sure in coming in the end we were able to convince them and continued the trip. At total there were more or less 15 people in a rented house. We were able to bond and spend time together, like cooking and sharing our own meals, eating bulalo, watching movies and partying</p>

			<h2>4. 20th Birthday</h2>
			<p>On the month of June, I celebrated my Birthday on the 11th day with my family together with my mother and brother because my father and sister wasn`t able to come due to them being abroad. We went outside to eat specifically in SM North Edsa. We casually eat there in a Korean restaurant called “Soban” then after that we went shopping with my mother the whole day. Though birthdays are usually special as I grow older I don`t expect from it that much, I noticed that everything within my life changes not only the people but also the surroundings which is not that bad though it makes me worry at times because we don`t know if it is good or bad though for me life should be live through constant changes by choosing and making the right choices, acceptance and rejection are unavoidable so we need to adjust for our own happiness. </p>

			<h2>5. Passing my 1st year</h2>
			<p>Even though it only has been more than half of the year of 2019, it gave me a lot of challenges and experiences in which I learned from. Given that it was only my first year in Benilde, time passes by neither fast nor slow. All I can say that It was an achievement and a highlight for me in passing this year. I am very grateful to all the people that had given me the opportunity to show my capabilities and skills as a student. I will continue in working hard and doing my best.</p>

		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>1. Finishing my 1st year</h2>
			<p>It was very hard because it was my first year in college though I`ve learned a lot during the year. I will continue doing my best and exerting my whole effort in my studies. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>2. Going abroad</h2>
			<p>I used to lived abroad with my mom and dad. It doesn`t change the fact that living in a different country where I was born from creates a difference whether it regards in our emotional and physical being, also the sense of lacking towards culture, family and self.</p>
			</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>3. Commuting</h2>
			<p>There are a lot of days where commuting becomes a struggle for me because it is what takes me to school and a lot of places that I needed to go to. It sometimes causes me to be late or absent.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>4. Time Management</h2>
			<p>During my first year I notice that time management is a must because in my high school days I was used to cramming my activities and assignments. At first It was very hard for me to adjust because it is not something that I used to doing but as the time goes by, I needed to adapt and adjust quickly to be able to survive in college.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>5. Timidness</h2>
			<p>Same concept as time management, it is one of my disadvantageous personality which is to be timid in front of a crowd or people. My timidness certainly affects not only my academics because the lack of participation in class but also my social life in college. Though now I learn how to socialize and adapt to my surroundings sometimes I still get timid in front of the people I don`t know, but when needed I muster up the courage to speak up.</p>
