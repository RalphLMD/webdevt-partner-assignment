			<h2>1. I was able to live through my first year</h2>
			<p>It is really a relief that I was able to live through my first year of college. All of the project and activities we did, I have passed them even some of my subject were bearly passing or clutch. But all of that hard work, there is all way some downfall. Mine was kinda hard to accept that I failed one subject and I need to retake it. But what I can do is learn from this mistake to make myself even better. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>2. I was able to help in big events</h2>
			<p>I am glad to be able to join organizations. Mostly I am just aiming to have free access to big event like ESGS and other events that that the org that I have joined is handle ling or helping. The things that the orgs do are really fun. Helping major event and other stuff and being a part of it is really fun, even though it is a little bit hard and tiring and like I have said it is all worth it because of the free access that we have to the events.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>3. I was able to stay out all night with my close friends</h2>
			<p>Ever since that I have turn into 20 years old, this is one of my greatest achievement that I had for my life. My parent are allowing me to stay outside hanging out late night with my friend and go to place that we always wanted to go. Ever since my parent doesn’t allow me to go out.</p>

			<h2>4. I was invited to join AIM as an officer</h2>
			<p>Out of nowhere, I was one of the office in my current of approach me and invited to part of organization’s next generation of who will be running the Organization bright future. I was nominated to part of the org’s officer because I was one of the active member that they had and they think I am fit to be part of the officer of AIM. There were a lot of use, who were nominated to be part of becoming an officer. We were all going to replace the officers who will be graduating for this year. But before we can be place on the slot that is needed to be replace, we were interview if we know what to do, how things work and, why should they take me and be an officer in this organization. Gladly after a week of their discussion they relies the result and I am part of the officers and my role is asst. operations.</p>

			<h2>5. Timidness</h2>
			<p>Same concept as time management, it is one of my disadvantageous personality which is to be timid in front of a crowd or people. My timidness certainly affects not only my academics because the lack of participation in class but also my social life in college. Though now I learn how to socialize and adapt to my surroundings sometimes I still get timid in front of the people I don`t know, but when needed I muster up the courage to speak up.</p>

	<h1 class="section-heading">Challenges</h1>
	<div class="challenges-section">
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>1. I failed a subject</h2>
			<p>For this year the hardest challenge for me, is to find out that I have failed a subject. The part that I am most scared of for this is that how I would tell my parents that I have failed a subject. Even though I listened, participate, and do what the professor assigned us to do, I still failed, and accepting this is really hard. Because this is the first time, for a long time that I failed a subject again. But this maybe a good or bad thing but this is a time to get better ng grow from it. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>2. Time management</h2>
			<p>Ever since I entered senior high school, this is one of the causes that I fail doing the goes that I want to do. Time management is something that is uncontrollable for me. Being laziness and cramming is mostly consuming my time, making me unproductive. I have always made my priority in playing games, than my subject and this is the reason I failed a subject. My lack I self-control is having a huge effect in my life mostly in the way I manage my time which I regret doing. But it is really hard to fix by just doing it by self.</p>		
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>3. My body clock change sleeping became difficult</h2>
			<p>Like what I have said the lack of self-control is having a huge effect in my life and it is bad. This concerns with my health. My body clock have changed because of this uncontrollable self. My Immune system have decrease it effect because of this kind of life stay, leading to be easily getting sick. Changing this is really hard. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>4. Living the way I want to live</h2>
			<p>I have lots of dreams in my life, but living to it is really hard. Self control is the main problem. Not having the sense of direction where to go, what to do and how should I do it or simply how to live my life the way I want it. Lacking the motivation to life and the loosening of the grip of living. Controlling this is really hard. Life cannot be control, all though I can change on how I can deal with it or move on what situation I am facing but I don’t know how? </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="container-hc">
			<h2>5. Telling my parents </h2>
			<p>This is my long term problem in my life is telling my parent is how I really bout thing that is happening in my life. Opening to them is something for out of the question all though they are the ones who will have the answer. We always have small talks nothing more nothing less. I really don’t have good communication with them, leading to misunderstanding leading to fights or argument which leads to nothing. Talking to them and always having some other idea on what is happening or it is just how I see it? Maybe I am the one who is not trying to understand them in trying to dodge judgement or something…. I don’t know. Opening is the hardest and I think I can’t open to them. </p>
